Sandbox just for learning webpack. After install webpack as a project dev dependency, it was pretty easy to create an entry file
which got compiled into the bundle.js file. The bundle js file was the file given to the index.html file.

Running `webpack ./entry.js bundle.js` then serving with `serve`

content.js was required in entry.js and compiled into bundle.js then served to index.html. Simples.
