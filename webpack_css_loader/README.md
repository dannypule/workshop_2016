webpack css loader 
---

Run this with:
npm run s

Hacking around with the getting started at https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/
Installed webpack-dev-server, css-loader and style-loader
Works quite well.

Update: 
extended this sandbox to work with sass
Adding sass was easy by installing sass-loader, node-sass then a minor update to webpack.config
scss file was required in entry.js
